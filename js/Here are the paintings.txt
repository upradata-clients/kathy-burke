Here are the paintings I would like to put in the Gallery Art Vector that my site will begin with.
They start at the left and move to the right.
And many will be just segments of the whole painting.
You can let me know when youâ€™re ready what it will look like.
And you may ask me for higher quality photos which I should be able to find on my computer.
